you can use this pgp key to encrypt ur messages to me and only i can decrypt it.
:3c

first add my public key with `gpg --import "joeymanny PUBLIC.asc"`

you should be able to use `gpg -e -r joeymanny mymessage.txt` to encrypt ur message

unless im a dumbass and that's not how you do it, which is very possible

im def a dumbass but you're prolly smarter than me im sure you'll figure it out <3
